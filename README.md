Points to consider: 

1) Sign Page and Join Page are single screen with toggle on top 

2) Sign Page and Join Page needs to be implemented on Modal 

3) Account Tab needs to be active when the screen is rendered 

4) Use Flat list to render all the menu items.


Refer src -> components -> BottomNavig.js for the code
